We are going to create a website. 
We will use Flask backend. 
The website will use a bootstrap css navigation bar along the top with home, blog, projects, contact as main pages. 
the home page will contain the navigation bar with links and "hello world!" displayed in bold text.
Implement a home.html template, a blog.html template, projects.html template and contact.html template and implement the links to them from the navigation bar.
